# Simple Weather Screen
An extremely simple weather screen built originally for a digital sign.

## What was Used

This site is built using Bootstrap 4, Azure Functions, ZipCodeApi, and the Darksky API.

## How To

If you would like to run this yourself you can register for the [ZipCodeAPI](https://www.zipcodeapi.com/Register) and the [Darksky API](https://darksky.net/dev/register).

The back end API is hosted in Azure Functions, you can create an Azure Function and run it for free (up to a million runs a month). Just copy the code in the azure_functions folder. You will need to replace the API keys where noted.
